## Code Explaination
- Our main focus for this project was to implement a fully digital signup page, a cleaner order interface, and a more streamline member login process.
- We used express and handlebars to handle the routing and visual rendering of the data.
- We created a database via Sequelize in order to handle the information that users will be entering into the website: 
	- New Members
	- Comments
	- Orders
	- Member Login info
- We used passport.js to enrcypt member passwords and stored the encrypted values unto the members table in order to maximize security.
